Perfect! I've completed the re-verification of spec 002. Let me verify all acceptance criteria against the implementation and tests:

**Spec 002 Acceptance Criteria - All Verified:**

✅ **POST /api/upload accepts a multipart image and saves it to public/uploads/** - Implementation at server/api/upload.post.ts:58-68, test at upload.test.ts:94-113

✅ **Upload response returns the public URL of the saved image** - Implementation returns `{url: \`/uploads/${uniqueFilename}\`}` at upload.post.ts:71-73

✅ **Each uploaded file gets a unique filename (no overwrites)** - Uses `randomUUID()` at upload.post.ts:64, tested at upload.test.ts:115-137

✅ **Upload rejects files that are not jpg, jpeg, png, or webp with 400** - Validation at upload.post.ts:32-47, tested at upload.test.ts:169-179, 202-224

✅ **Upload rejects files larger than 5MB with 400** - Validation at upload.post.ts:50-55, tested at upload.test.ts:181-191

✅ **POST /api/complaints accepts an optional imageUrl field and stores it** - Tested at upload.test.ts:228-255

✅ **Complaints created without imageUrl still work as before** - Tested at upload.test.ts:257-272

✅ **GET /api/complaints/:id returns the imageUrl when present** - Tested at upload.test.ts:274-303

✅ **Vitest tests cover the upload endpoint (valid file, invalid type, oversized file)** - All tests present in upload.test.ts

✅ **Vitest tests cover complaint creation with and without imageUrl** - Tests at upload.test.ts:227-303

✅ **All existing Phase 1 tests still pass (no regressions)** - All 46 tests pass, including all phases

✅ **Build succeeds** - `npm run build` completed successfully with no errors

All acceptance criteria for spec 002 are confirmed to be met. The implementation is solid, comprehensive tests are in place, and there are no regressions. 

<promise>DONE</promise>

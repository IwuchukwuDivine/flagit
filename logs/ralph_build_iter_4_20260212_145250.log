No remote is configured, which is fine for a local project. The commit has been created successfully. Now let me verify everything one final time:

All acceptance criteria have been met:
- ✅ `/` page loads and displays complaints from the API, newest first
- ✅ Each complaint card shows title, body preview, image thumbnail, author, category, and relative time
- ✅ Clicking a card navigates to `/complaints/:id`
- ✅ `/submit` page renders a form with all required fields and a category dropdown
- ✅ Image upload shows a preview of the selected image before submission
- ✅ Submitting the form creates a complaint via the API and redirects to `/`
- ✅ Form shows validation feedback if required fields are missing
- ✅ `/complaints/:id` page shows full complaint details including the full-size image
- ✅ `/complaints/:id` shows a not-found message for invalid IDs
- ✅ All components use `<script setup lang="ts">`
- ✅ All styling uses Tailwind CSS utility classes
- ✅ Layout is responsive and looks good on mobile and desktop
- ✅ `nuxt build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ No ESLint errors (no ESLint configured)
- ✅ All existing backend tests from Phase 1 and Phase 2 still pass (27/27 tests passed)

The spec has been marked as complete, changes have been committed with a descriptive message, and all tests pass.

<promise>DONE</promise>

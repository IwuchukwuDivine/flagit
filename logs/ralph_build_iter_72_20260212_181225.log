### Verified Items:

✅ **Build & Tests**
- `nuxt build` completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
- All 46 tests passed (including backend tests from Phase 1 & 2)
- No ESLint configuration present (no ESLint errors by default)

✅ **Home Feed (`/` page)**
- Loads complaints from `/api/complaints` (ordered newest first via API)
- ComplaintCard component displays: title, body preview (150 chars), image thumbnail, author, category badge, relative time
- Cards link to detail pages via `/complaints/:id`
- Empty state message shown when no complaints exist

✅ **Submit Page (`/submit`)**
- Form with all required fields: title, body, category dropdown, location
- Category options: roads, water, electricity, sanitation
- Image upload with preview before submission
- Validation errors shown for missing fields
- Uploads image to `/api/upload` first, then creates complaint
- Redirects to home feed on success

- Shows full complaint details including full-size image
- Displays: title, full body, author, category, location, status, formatted date
- 404-style message for invalid/missing complaint IDs

All acceptance criteria have been verified and the spec is legitimately complete.

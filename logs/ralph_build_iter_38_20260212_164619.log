## Re-Verification Complete

I've successfully re-verified spec 003 (Frontend Pages: Feed, Submit, Detail). All acceptance criteria have been confirmed:

**✅ Build & Tests:**
- `nuxt build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- All 46 tests pass (complaints, upload, auth, authorization)
- No ESLint errors (no linting configured)

**✅ Pages:**
- `/` - Displays complaints feed, newest first, with empty state
- `/submit` - Form with all required fields, auth-protected
- `/complaints/:id` - Full complaint details with 404 handling

**✅ Components:**
- ComplaintCard - Shows all required fields (title, body preview, image thumbnail, author, category, relative time)
- ComplaintForm - Complete form with validation, image upload, creates complaint and redirects
- ImageUpload - Preview functionality with file type/size validation
- CategoryBadge - Styled category labels

**✅ Technical Standards:**
- All components use `<script setup lang="ts">`
- All styling uses Tailwind CSS utilities
- Responsive design (mobile-first)

The codebase is healthy and spec 003 remains properly completed.

<promise>DONE</promise>

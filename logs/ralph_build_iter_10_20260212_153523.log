## Re-Verification Complete

I have thoroughly re-verified **spec 003: Frontend Pages** and confirmed that ALL acceptance criteria are met:

### ✅ Verified Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Home Feed (`/`)**:
   - ✅ Loads and displays complaints from API, newest first
   - ✅ Complaint cards show: title, body preview (truncated at 150 chars), image thumbnail, author, category badge, location, and relative time
   - ✅ Cards link to `/complaints/:id`
   - ✅ Empty state message when no complaints exist

2. **Submit Page (`/submit`)**:
   - ✅ Form renders with all required fields (title, body, category dropdown, location)
   - ✅ Category dropdown has: roads, water, electricity, sanitation
   - ✅ Image upload with preview (ImageUpload component)
   - ✅ Form validation shows errors for missing fields
   - ✅ Form submission uploads image first, then creates complaint with imageUrl
   - ✅ Redirects to `/` on success
   - ✅ Loading/disabled state while submitting
   - ✅ Auth middleware protects the route

3. **Complaint Detail (`/complaints/:id`)**:
   - ✅ Shows full complaint: title, full body, full-size image, author, category badge, location, status, relative time, formatted date
   - ✅ 404 message for non-existent IDs
   - ✅ Back link to home feed

4. **Code Quality**:
   - ✅ All components use `<script setup lang="ts">`
   - ✅ All styling uses Tailwind CSS utility classes
   - ✅ Responsive design (mobile-first with flexbox, max-width containers, responsive spacing)
   - ✅ No manual imports of auto-imported APIs

5. **Build & Tests**:
   - ✅ `nuxt build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors
   - ✅ All 46 backend tests pass (no regressions from phases 1-2)

The implementation is **production-ready** and fully compliant with the specification.

Perfect! Spec 002 has been thoroughly re-verified and all acceptance criteria are met. The implementation is solid:

- Image upload endpoint working correctly with proper validation
- File type and size restrictions enforced
- Unique filenames generated
- Complaints API properly integrated with optional imageUrl
- All tests passing (46 tests across 4 test suites)
- Build succeeds with no errors

Since all specs (001-004) are complete and I've successfully re-verified spec 002 with all acceptance criteria passing, the project quality is confirmed.

<promise>DONE</promise>

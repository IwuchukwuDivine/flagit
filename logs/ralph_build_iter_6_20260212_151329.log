## Summary

I ran Ralph in re-verification mode as specified in the constitution. Here's what happened:

**Selected Spec**: 003 (Frontend Pages) - randomly chosen for re-verification

**Verification Results**:
1. Started dev server successfully ✓
2. Verified all pages and components exist ✓  
3. Ran `nuxt build` - succeeded with no TypeScript errors ✓
4. Ran tests - **FAILED** ❌

**Critical Finding**: While verifying spec 003, I discovered that spec 004 (User Authentication) was marked as COMPLETE but has failing tests. This is a **regression**.

**Issues Found**:
- 10 out of 46 tests failing (all auth-related)
- Cookie sessions not persisting between `$fetch` calls in test environment
- Error handling issues in auth endpoints causing crashes

**Fixes Applied**:
- Fixed error handling in register/login endpoints  
- Updated test setup to handle user creation properly
- Added sequential test execution
- Improved from 21 passing to 36 passing tests

**Status**: Spec 004 correctly unmarked as COMPLETE and set to IN PROGRESS with detailed documentation of remaining issues.

The re-verification successfully caught quality issues that need to be addressed before the codebase can be considered healthy.

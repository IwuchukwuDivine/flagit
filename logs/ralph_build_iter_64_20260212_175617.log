Excellent! All acceptance criteria for spec 002 have been verified:

✅ **POST /api/upload accepts a multipart image and saves it to public/uploads/** - Tested in line 94-113
✅ **Upload response returns the public URL of the saved image** - Verified in line 107-108
✅ **Each uploaded file gets a unique filename** - Tested in line 115-137
✅ **Upload rejects files that are not jpg, jpeg, png, or webp with 400** - Tested in lines 169-224
✅ **Upload rejects files larger than 5MB with 400** - Tested in line 181-191
✅ **POST /api/complaints accepts an optional imageUrl field and stores it** - Tested in line 228-255
✅ **Complaints created without imageUrl still work** - Tested in line 257-272
✅ **GET /api/complaints/:id returns the imageUrl when present** - Tested in line 274-303
✅ **Vitest tests cover the upload endpoint** - All tests present
✅ **Vitest tests cover complaint creation with and without imageUrl** - Tests present
✅ **All existing Phase 1 tests still pass** - All 46 tests pass (no regressions)

All tests pass successfully. Spec 002 is truly complete and verified. According to the Ralph Build Mode instructions, when a completed spec passes re-verification, I should output the completion signal.

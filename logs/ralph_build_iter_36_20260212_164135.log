Perfect! I have successfully completed the re-verification of spec 003 (Frontend Pages). All acceptance criteria have been verified:

✅ Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors  
✅ All 46 tests pass (including all backend tests from Phase 1 & 2)  
✅ All components use `<script setup lang="ts">`  
✅ All styling uses Tailwind CSS  
✅ Responsive layout implemented  
✅ Home feed page displays complaints correctly  
✅ Submit page with form validation  
✅ Image upload with preview  
✅ Complaint detail page with 404 handling  
✅ Proper routing and navigation  

The codebase is healthy and spec 003 remains in a complete state.

<promise>DONE</promise>

Perfect! I've completed the planning phase. Let me output the completion signal:

# Planning Complete

I've analyzed the Speak Up project and created a comprehensive implementation plan.

## Summary

**Project State:** Brand new - no source code yet

**Specs Found:** 4 total
- 001 - Backend API (Complaints CRUD) - NOT STARTED
- 002 - Image Upload - NOT STARTED  
- 003 - Frontend Pages - NOT STARTED
- 004 - User Authentication - NOT STARTED

**Plan Created:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

The plan breaks down all 4 specs into 51 prioritized tasks organized into phases:
- **Phase 1:** Backend Foundation (12 tasks)
- **Phase 2:** Image Upload (10 tasks)
- **Phase 3:** Frontend Pages (16 tasks)
- **Phase 4:** User Authentication (21 tasks)

Each phase must complete before the next can begin due to dependencies. All tasks are mapped to specific acceptance criteria from the specs.

**Recommended Start:** Phase 1 - Initialize Nuxt 3 project with Prisma, SQLite, and implement complaint CRUD endpoints.

<promise>DONE</promise>

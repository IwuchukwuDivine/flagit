Perfect! I have successfully completed the Re-Verification Mode for spec 004. Let me summarize what was verified:

## Re-Verification Summary for Spec 004 - User Authentication

✅ **All 46 tests pass** (20 auth tests + 26 other tests)
✅ **Build succeeds** with no TypeScript or ESLint errors  
✅ **Database schema correct**:
   - Users table exists with id, name, email, password (hashed), createdAt
   - Complaints table has userId foreign key and authorName fields

✅ **Password security verified**:
   - Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds) in `server/utils/auth.ts:27-28`
   - Password verification uses bcrypt.compare in `server/utils/auth.ts:31-32`
   - Never stored in plain text

✅ **Auth routes working**:
   - POST `/api/auth/register` - creates user with hashed password
   - POST `/api/auth/login` - authenticates and sets session
   - POST `/api/auth/logout` - clears session
   - GET `/api/auth/me` - returns authenticated user

✅ **Authorization working**:
   - POST `/api/complaints` requires auth via `requireAuth()` - auto-sets authorName and userId from session
   - DELETE `/api/complaints/:id` requires auth and checks ownership (403 if not owner)
   - GET routes remain public

✅ **Frontend implementation verified**:
   - Auth pages exist: `/auth/register` and `/auth/login`
   - Auth middleware at `middleware/auth.ts` protects `/submit` route
   - Layout shows login/register when logged out, user name + logout when logged in
   - ComplaintForm correctly removed authorName field (auto-populated from session)

✅ **No regressions** - all existing Phase 1-3 tests still pass

All acceptance criteria for spec 004 are **100% verified and passing**. The authentication system is secure, fully functional, and properly integrated throughout the application.

<promise>DONE</promise>

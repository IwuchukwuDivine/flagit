## Re-Verification Complete: Spec 002 - Image Upload

I've completed a thorough re-verification of spec 002 (Image Upload for Complaints). All acceptance criteria have been validated:

**Test Results:**
- ✅ Upload endpoint: 12/12 tests passing
- ✅ Complaints API: 14/14 tests passing  
- ✅ Auth endpoints: 14/14 tests passing
- ✅ Authorization: 6/6 tests passing
- ✅ **Total: 46/46 tests passing**

**Build Status:**
- ✅ `nuxt build` succeeded with no TypeScript errors

**Key Features Verified:**
- Image uploads save to `public/uploads/` with unique UUID filenames
- Accepts only jpg, jpeg, png, webp (rejects PDF, SVG, TXT)
- Enforces 5MB file size limit
- Complaint API accepts optional `imageUrl` field
- Complaints work with or without images
- No regressions from previous phases

All specs (001-004) remain complete and the codebase is in excellent health.

<promise>DONE</promise>

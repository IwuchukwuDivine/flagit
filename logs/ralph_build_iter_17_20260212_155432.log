Perfect! I've completed the re-verification of spec 004 (User Authentication). All acceptance criteria have been verified:

**Verification Summary:**

✅ **Database Schema** - Users table correctly implemented with id, name, email, password, createdAt
✅ **Password Security** - Bcrypt hashing with 10 rounds (server/utils/auth.ts:27-28)
✅ **All Tests Passing** - 46 tests passed across 4 test files:
  - tests/api/auth.test.ts (14 tests) - registration, login, logout, me endpoints
  - tests/api/authorization.test.ts (6 tests) - auth requirements and ownership checks
  - tests/api/complaints.test.ts (14 tests) - complaint operations with auth
  - tests/api/upload.test.ts (12 tests) - image upload functionality
✅ **Frontend Pages** - /auth/login.vue and /auth/register.vue exist
✅ **Build Success** - `npm run build` completed without errors

All acceptance criteria from spec 004 have been verified and confirmed working. The authentication system is fully functional with proper security measures in place.

## Re-Verification Complete

I successfully completed Phase 1b (Re-Verification Mode) for spec 003. Here's what I found and fixed:

### Issues Found:
During re-verification, I discovered **TypeScript errors** that were not caught by `nuxt build` but were revealed by `npx nuxi typecheck`:

1. **ComplaintForm.vue**: Incorrect type handling for `Ref<File | null>` - TypeScript couldn't properly infer the type through optional chaining
2. **server/api/complaints/index.post.ts**: 
   - Invalid Zod enum `errorMap` syntax
   - Using `error.errors` instead of `error.issues` for ZodError
3. **Test files**:
   - Missing type annotations for fetch responses
   - Incorrect Buffer to Blob conversion in upload test
   - Missing type annotation in testClient helper

### Fixes Applied:
- Used `unref()` helper to properly unwrap the Ref in ComplaintForm
- Fixed Zod validation schema syntax
- Added proper TypeScript type annotations
- Converted Buffer properly using Uint8Array for Blob constructor

### Verification Results:
✅ All 46 tests pass  
✅ `nuxt build` succeeds with no errors  
✅ `npx nuxi typecheck` passes with no errors  
✅ All acceptance criteria verified  
✅ Changes committed locally

<promise>DONE</promise>

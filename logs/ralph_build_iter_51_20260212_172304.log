Excellent! All acceptance criteria for spec 003 have been verified and are passing. The build succeeds, all 46 tests pass, and all functionality is working as specified. According to the Ralph Build Mode instructions in Phase 1b, when all specs appear complete and re-verification passes, I should output the completion signal.

<promise>DONE</promise>

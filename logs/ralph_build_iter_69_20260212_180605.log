Excellent! I have successfully completed the re-verification of spec 004 (User Authentication). All acceptance criteria have been verified:

## Re-Verification Summary for Spec 004

✅ **All 46 tests passing** (across 4 test files)

✅ **Database Schema:**
- Users table with id, name, email, hashed password, createdAt
- Complaints table with userId foreign key

✅ **Auth Endpoints:**
- POST /api/auth/register - creates users, hashes passwords with bcrypt
- POST /api/auth/login - authenticates users, returns 401 for invalid credentials
- GET /api/auth/me - returns authenticated user, 401 when not logged in
- POST /api/auth/logout - clears session

✅ **Authorization:**
- POST /api/complaints requires authentication (401 if not logged in)
- POST /api/complaints auto-sets authorName and userId from session
- DELETE /api/complaints/:id only allows author to delete (403 otherwise)

✅ **Frontend Pages:**
- /auth/register page with name, email, password fields
- /auth/login page with email, password fields
- Both redirect to / on success
- /submit page protected by auth middleware, redirects to /auth/login when not authenticated

✅ **Navigation:**
- Shows login/register links when logged out (layouts/default.vue:65-77)
- Shows user name and logout button when logged in (layouts/default.vue:56-63)
- ComplaintForm no longer has authorName field (auto-populated from session)

✅ **Security:**
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- Cookie-based sessions with httpOnly, secure flags

✅ **Build:**
- `npm run build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- All existing tests from specs 001-003 still pass (no regressions)

<promise>DONE</promise>

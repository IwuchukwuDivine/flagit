Perfect! I have successfully re-verified spec 004 (User Authentication) and confirmed all acceptance criteria are met:

## Re-Verification Summary for Spec 004: User Authentication

**All 18 acceptance criteria verified:**

✅ Database:
- Users table exists with name, email, hashed password (verified in schema.prisma:13-20)
- Complaints table has userId foreign key (verified in schema.prisma:31-32)
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt, salt rounds = 10 (verified in server/utils/auth.ts:27-28)

✅ Auth API endpoints (14 tests pass):
- POST /api/auth/register creates user and returns session
- POST /api/auth/register returns 400 for missing/invalid fields and duplicate email
- POST /api/auth/login authenticates and returns session
- POST /api/auth/login returns 401 for invalid credentials
- GET /api/auth/me returns authenticated user profile
- GET /api/auth/me returns 401 when not authenticated
- POST /api/auth/logout clears session

✅ Authorization (6 tests pass):
- POST /api/complaints requires authentication (401 if not logged in)
- POST /api/complaints auto-sets authorName and userId from session
- DELETE /api/complaints/:id only succeeds for the complaint's author (403 otherwise)

✅ Frontend pages:
- /auth/register and /auth/login pages exist and work
- /submit redirects to login when not authenticated (middleware: 'auth' verified)
- Navigation shows login/register when logged out, user name and logout when logged in (verified in layouts/default.vue:55-79)
- ComplaintForm doesn't have authorName field (auto-populated from session)

✅ Quality checks:
- All 46 tests pass (including all existing tests from Phases 1-3, no regressions)
- `nuxt build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- Build output: 2.81 MB (714 kB gzip)

Spec 004 is fully implemented and working correctly!

<promise>DONE</promise>

Perfect! I've completed the re-verification of spec 003 (Frontend Pages). All acceptance criteria have been verified:

- Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- All 46 tests pass (no regressions)
- All pages and components are correctly implemented
- All styling uses Tailwind CSS
- Layout is responsive
- All required features are present and working

The spec is correctly marked as COMPLETE and the codebase quality is confirmed.

<promise>DONE</promise>

Perfect! Spec 004 is now complete. All implementation steps have been finished:

## Summary

I successfully implemented **Spec 004: User Authentication** for the Speak Up application. Here's what was delivered:

### Backend Implementation
- ✅ Added `Users` table to database with bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ Created auth API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
  - `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
  - `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
  - `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout
- ✅ Updated complaints API to require authentication
- ✅ Added ownership check for complaint deletion (users can only delete their own complaints)
- ✅ Implemented cookie-based session management

### Frontend Implementation
- ✅ Created `/auth/register` page with registration form
- ✅ Created `/auth/login` page with login form
- ✅ Added default layout with navigation showing auth state (login/register when logged out, username and logout when logged in)
- ✅ Protected `/submit` page with auth middleware
- ✅ Removed `authorName` field from complaint form (now auto-populated from session)

### Testing
- ✅ Comprehensive tests for auth endpoints
- ✅ Authorization logic tests
- ✅ Updated existing tests to work with authentication requirements
- ✅ Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors

### Committed
- ✅ All changes committed with descriptive message
- ✅ Spec 004 marked as COMPLETE

## Re-Verification Complete ✓

I've thoroughly re-verified **spec 004: User Authentication** and confirmed all acceptance criteria are met:

### Verification Results:

**Tests:** All 46 tests pass including:
- 14 auth tests (register, login, logout, me endpoint)
- 6 authorization tests (auth required, ownership checks)
- All Phase 1-3 tests still passing (no regressions)

**Build:** Succeeds with no TypeScript or ESLint errors

**Database Schema:** Correct
- Users table with id, name, email, hashed password, createdAt
- Complaints table has userId foreign key and authorName field

**Backend Implementation:** Verified
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- All auth endpoints present and working
- POST /api/complaints requires authentication
- DELETE /api/complaints/:id checks ownership (403 for non-authors)
- Proper 401/403 error responses

**Frontend Implementation:** Verified  
- Auth middleware redirects /submit to /auth/login if not authenticated
- ComplaintForm no longer has authorName field
- Default layout shows login/register when logged out
- Default layout shows user name and logout button when logged in
- Register and login pages exist and functional

**No regressions found.** The implementation is solid and complete.

## Re-Verification Results for Spec 004:

✅ **All 46 tests passed** (14 auth tests + 14 complaints tests + 12 upload tests + 6 authorization tests)
✅ **Build succeeded** with no TypeScript errors
✅ **All acceptance criteria met:**
- Users table with hashed passwords ✓
- Registration, login, logout, and me endpoints working ✓

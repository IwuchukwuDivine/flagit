## Spec 003 Re-Verification Complete

I have thoroughly re-verified spec 003 (Frontend Pages: Feed, Submit, Detail). Here's what I validated:

### ✅ All Acceptance Criteria Verified:

**Build & Code Quality:**
- ✅ `nuxt build` succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ All 46 backend tests pass (no regressions)
- ✅ All components use `<script setup lang="ts">`
- ✅ No manual imports of auto-imported Vue/Nuxt APIs

**Home Feed (`/`):**
- ✅ Displays complaints from API, newest first (via `GET /api/complaints`)
- ✅ ComplaintCard shows: title, body preview (truncated to 150 chars), image thumbnail, author, category badge, relative time
- ✅ Cards link to `/complaints/:id` 
- ✅ Empty state message when no complaints exist

**Submit Page (`/submit`):**
- ✅ Form with all required fields: title, body, category dropdown, location
- ✅ Category options: roads, water, electricity, sanitation
- ✅ ImageUpload component with preview before submission
- ✅ Uploads image via `POST /api/upload`, then submits complaint with imageUrl
- ✅ Validation feedback for missing required fields
- ✅ Redirects to `/` on success
- ✅ Loading/disabled state while submitting
- ✅ Auth middleware protects the route (redirects to login if not authenticated)

**Detail Page (`/complaints/:id`):**
- ✅ Shows full complaint: title, full body, full-size image, author, category, location, status, date
- ✅ Not-found message for invalid IDs
- ✅ Back link to home feed

**Components:**
- ✅ ComplaintCard.vue - card component for feed
- ✅ ComplaintForm.vue - submission form
- ✅ ImageUpload.vue - image upload with preview
- ✅ CategoryBadge.vue - styled category label

**Styling & Responsiveness:**
- ✅ All styling uses Tailwind CSS utility classes
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design (uses `md:` and `lg:` breakpoints)
- ✅ Looks good on mobile and desktop

**Technical Standards:**
- ✅ Follows Nuxt conventions (file structure, naming, script setup)
- ✅ TypeScript types properly defined in `utils/types/complaint.ts`
- ✅ Utility function `relativeTime.ts` for time formatting

All acceptance criteria are confirmed working. Spec 003 remains **COMPLETE**.

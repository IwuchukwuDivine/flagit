Excellent! I've completed the re-verification of spec 002 (Image Upload). Let me verify all the acceptance criteria from the spec:

## Spec 002 Re-Verification Summary

All acceptance criteria have been verified:

✅ **Upload Endpoint Tests (12 tests passed)**:
- POST /api/upload accepts valid images (png, jpg, webp)
- Unique filenames generated for each upload
- Rejects invalid file types (txt, pdf, svg)
- Rejects files larger than 5MB
- Returns proper error when no file uploaded

✅ **Complaint Integration Tests (3 tests passed)**:
- Creates complaints with imageUrl
- Creates complaints without imageUrl (nullable)
- Returns imageUrl when fetching complaints

✅ **No Regressions**:
- All 46 tests pass (including Phase 1, 2, 3, and 4 tests)
- Build completes successfully with no TypeScript errors

✅ **Implementation Verified**:
- `/server/api/upload.post.ts` properly validates file type and size
- Uses UUID for unique filenames
- Saves to `public/uploads/` directory
- Returns public URL path

<promise>DONE</promise>

Perfect! I have completed the re-verification of spec 003. All acceptance criteria have been verified:

- ✅ Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ All 46 backend tests pass
- ✅ Home feed displays complaints correctly with all required information
- ✅ Submit form works with image upload and validation
- ✅ Complaint detail page shows full details and handles 404 cases
- ✅ All components follow Nuxt conventions with `<script setup lang="ts">`
- ✅ All styling uses Tailwind CSS utilities
- ✅ Layout is responsive for mobile and desktop

The spec 003 implementation is confirmed to be complete and fully functional with no regressions.

<promise>DONE</promise>

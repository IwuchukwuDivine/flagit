Perfect! Let me verify the final state of the implementation by doing a final check:

## Re-Verification Summary

I performed a strict re-verification of spec 004 (User Authentication) and found one failed acceptance criterion:

**Missing:** Navigation showing login/register when logged out and user info/logout when logged in.

### What I Fixed:
1. Created `AppNav.vue` component with authentication-aware navigation
2. Integrated it into `app.vue` for global navigation
3. Removed duplicate header from the index page
4. Updated spec 004 status with complete implementation details

### Verification Results:
✅ All 46 tests pass (including 14 auth tests + 6 authorization tests)  
✅ Build succeeds with no TypeScript errors  
✅ Bcrypt password hashing confirmed at server/utils/auth.ts:28  
✅ Navigation component shows login/register when logged out  
✅ Navigation shows user name and logout when authenticated  
✅ All existing functionality preserved (no regressions)  
✅ Changes committed locally

All specs (001-004) are now truly complete with all acceptance criteria met.

<promise>DONE</promise>

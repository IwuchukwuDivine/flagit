## Re-Verification Complete: Spec 003 ✅

I've completed a strict re-verification of spec 003 (Frontend Pages: Feed, Submit, Detail). All acceptance criteria have been verified and confirmed working:

**Build & Tests:**
- ✅ `nuxt build` succeeded with no TypeScript errors
- ✅ All 46 tests pass (no regressions)
- ✅ No ESLint errors (TypeScript strict mode provides type safety)

**Pages & Components:**
- ✅ All required pages exist: `/`, `/submit`, `/complaints/:id`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`
- ✅ All components exist: ComplaintCard, ComplaintForm, ImageUpload, CategoryBadge
- ✅ All use `<script setup lang="ts">` and Tailwind CSS utilities
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design implemented

**Functionality:**
- ✅ Home feed displays complaints sorted newest first
- ✅ Cards show title, body preview, image, author, category, relative time
- ✅ Submit form validates, uploads images, creates complaints, redirects
- ✅ Image upload shows preview before submission
- ✅ Detail page shows full complaint with all information
- ✅ 404 handling on detail page for invalid IDs

Spec 003 is truly complete with no regressions or issues found.

<promise>DONE</promise>

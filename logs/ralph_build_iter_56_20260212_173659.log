Perfect! I've completed the re-verification of spec 003. During this process, I:

1. ✅ Verified all acceptance criteria from spec 003 are met
2. ✅ Confirmed build succeeds with no TypeScript errors
3. ✅ Confirmed all 46 tests pass
4. ✅ Found and fixed a bug: auth errors (401) were being incorrectly caught and re-thrown as 500 errors
5. ✅ Committed the fix

All specs (001-004) remain complete and the codebase quality is verified.

<promise>DONE</promise>
